# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). I used this project more to learn how Frontend Mentor works, than to find a solution to this particular problem. Therefore the solution might not be as pretty as it could be.
